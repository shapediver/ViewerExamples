### Attribute Visualization

The examples in this section show different use cases of how to use [attribute visualization](https://viewer.shapediver.com/v3/latest/api/features/attribute-visualization/index.html).

With our Grasshopper Plugin and the invention of [sdTF](https://github.com/shapediver/sdTF) a lot more data can be added to your models. This data can potentially be anything at all, in this case, weâ€™ll look at how we can visualize primitive data. This can be expanded by yourself to much more complex data though. Attributes are key-value pairs that can be specified at every step of the node tree. The number and type of attributes does not have to be consistent over the scene tree.
