### Scene Tree Manipulation

The examples in this section show different use cases of how to manipulate the [scene tree](https://viewer.shapediver.com/v3/latest/api/interfaces/ITree.html).

This application has it's own [scene tree](https://viewer.shapediver.com/v3/latest/api/interfaces/ITree.html) in which sessions store their computed outputs as [nodes](https://viewer.shapediver.com/v3/latest/api/interfaces/ITreeNode.html), but you can also create, adjust and remove parts of the scene tree yourself.
