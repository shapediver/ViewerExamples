### Session

The examples in this section show different use cases of how to use [sessions](https://viewer.shapediver.com/v3/latest/api/interfaces/ISessionApi.html). There are separate sub-sections for [parameters](https://viewer.shapediver.com/v3/latest/api/interfaces/IParameterApi.html), [exports](https://viewer.shapediver.com/v3/latest/api/interfaces/IExportApi.html) and [outputs](https://viewer.shapediver.com/v3/latest/api/interfaces/IOutputApi.html).

Your models running on ShapeDiver are hosted on one of our Geometry Backend systems. The access to triggering customizations and downloading computation results is controlled by [sessions](https://viewer.shapediver.com/v3/latest/api/interfaces/ISessionApi.html). In order to create a session from an instance of the viewer embedded in a website, you need to provide a ticket for embedding.
