### Post-Processing

Post-processing refers to applying additional visual effects or modifications to a rendered scene after it has been initially drawn to the screen. This technique is commonly used to enhance the overall look and feel of a 3D scene or to achieve specific visual effects like ambient occlusion, bloom, motion blur, depth-of-field and more.
